# Marjane Partner Network – Vitrine Website  
Stage d’initiation Project

This project is a **vitrine website** developed during my **stage d’initiation at Marjane**.  
It presents a strategic concept where Marjane becomes a **platform that connects local partner stores** under one strong brand.

The website is designed to show how Marjane can expand its presence through a **network of small shops**, all powered by Marjane’s identity and digital infrastructure.

##  Project Concept

The idea behind this project is to create a **partnership ecosystem**:

Marjane partners with:
- Local grocery stores  
- Small supermarkets  
- Neighborhood shops  

These stores keep their physical location, but operate under:
- The **Marjane brand**
- The **Marjane digital platform**
- The **Marjane standards**

So instead of building only big hypermarkets, Marjane grows through a **distributed network of partner stores**.

## Why This Strategy

This model allows Marjane to:

- Be present in **every neighborhood**
- Support **local businesses**
- Expand fast without building new big stores
- Control quality, branding, and digital services
- Collect data and improve logistics

It is a **win-win system**:
- Small shops gain the power of Marjane
- Marjane gains physical and digital coverage

## Role of the Website
